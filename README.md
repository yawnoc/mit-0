# MIT No Attribution (MIT-0)

"MIT No Attribution" is what it says on the tin:
the MIT license minus the attribution condition.
It is better than:

* the [WTFPL], which lacks a no-warranty clause
* the [Unlicense], which has [probable issues in Germany][unlicense germany]
* [CC0], which is not designed for software
  and [does not waive patents][cc0 patents].

[IANAL], but "MIT No Attribution" appears to be as legally robust
as the original MIT license, without the annoyance of requiring attribution.

**We need 1000 public repositories using "MIT No Attribution" to
[get it added to choosealicense.com][choosealicense]**,
so that it will eventually be added to [Licensee],
which is what GitHub uses for its license detection.

**Start using it!**
